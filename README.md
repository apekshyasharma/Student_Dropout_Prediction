## Project Overview
Student dropout is a critical issue in education systems worldwide. This project aims to predict the likelihood of a student dropping out by analyzing various factors such as demographic data, academic performance, and socio-economic conditions. By identifying at-risk students early, educational institutions can implement timely interventions to improve retention rates.
